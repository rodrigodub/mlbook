            <othercit>The boundary is a digital representation of the International boundary between the United States and Canada as per the Treaty of
              1908. It has been generated from a combination of recent surveys and datum conversions. It is intended for general mapping purposes
              only. The boundary dataset is composed of 29 segments that correspond to the original 256 boundary maps. Attributes of each segment
              define the scale in which the line in that area may be accurately depicted. It is produced for mapping purposes only and not intended to
              illustrate the boundary beyond the limits of the scale for any given segment</othercit>

            <geoform>vector digital data</geoform>
            <othercit>The international boundary between Mexico and the United States, defined as a joint venture between the U.S. Department of
              Agriculture (USDA) and the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia of Mexico (INEGI), resulted in an unofficial United
              States-Mexico boundary dataset that was further enhanced by the U.S. Geological Survey's Border Environmental Health Initiative (BEHI).
              With the data frame scale set to 1:5,000 in ArcMap, the center of the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo was digitized using the NAIP 2004 Imagery. In
              areas with dense stands of salt cedar (bounding box = UL -104.714 30.038, UR -104.664 30.037, LR -104.666 29.933, LL -104.717 29.934;
              NAD83), the center of the channel was difficult, and sometimes impossible, to easily determine. To determine the location of the
              boundary, the GIS analyst compared the location of the line in the INEGI 1:250K Limite feature class with the NAIP 2004 Imagery and
              adjusted the boundary to the image, thus, the delineation of the international boundary is less certain in these areas. The remaining
              part of the border was extracted from the INEGI 1:250K Limite feature class and appended to the line feature class created along the Rio
              Grande/Rio Bravo. The U.S. Geological Survey reviewed the original USDA data against 2007 NAIP imagery and further edited 9 line
              segments in the Rio Grande areas to conform to National Map Accuracy Standards.</othercit>

            <othercit>This dataset depicts the authoritative boundaries of the most commonly known Department of Defense (DoD) sites, installations,

              baseline for georeferenced boundaries of sites selected from the 2010 Base Structure Report. The boundary locations are intended for
              planning purposes only and do not represent the legal or surveyed land parcel boundaries. This list does not necessarily represent a
              comprehensive collection of all DoD facilities, and only those in the fifty United States and US Territories were considered for
              inclusion. Maps produced at a scale of 1:50,000 or larger which otherwise comply with National Map Accuracy Standards will remain
              compliant if this data is incorporated. Although these data have been provided by the DoD components, no warranty expressed or implied
              is made regarding the utility of the data on any other system, in derived products or data alterations, nor shall the act of
              distribution constitute such warranty.</othercit>

            <othercit>The Native American Area boundaries are as of January 1, 2017 as reported through Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation
              Survey. The USGS dataset is a combination of two Census Bureau files. It includes the American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian
              Areas National (AIANNH) National TIGER/Line shapefile, including the following legal entities: federally recognized American Indian
              reservations and off-reservation trust land areas, state-recognized American Indian reservations, and Hawaiian home lands. Also included
              is the Alaska Native Regional Corporation (ANRC) State-based TIGER/Line shapefile containing a record of the 12 Alaska Native Regional
              Corporations used to conduct both the for-profit and non-profit affairs of Alaska Natives within a defined region of Alaska. The USGS
              uses the TIGER data without editing or alteration.</othercit>

            <geoform>vector digital data</geoform>
            <othercit>This dataset depicts National Park Service unit boundaries for display and general analysis purposes. The USGS converted areas
              of generally 3 acres or less to point features to facilitate cartographic display on the US Topo digital map product. See Source URL for
              link to complete dataset. This data set is complete but subject to continual updates to reflect boundary amendments, legislation, and
              acquisitions, and improved processing techniques. The data is being regularly updated with verified boundaries from NPS Land Resources
              Division. The data is intended for use as a tool for display and general GIS analysis purposes only. It is in no way intended for
              engineering or legal purposes. The data accuracy is checked against best available sources which may be dated. NPS assumes no liability
              for use of this data. Boundaries from the Land Resources Division have separate polygons for each type of unit. For example Denali
              National Park and Denali National Preserve are separate individual polygons.</othercit>

            <title>FWS Interest Simplified Boundaries</title>
            <geoform>vector digital data</geoform>
            <othercit>This data set depicts simplified boundaries of lands administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service including National
              Wildlife Refuges, National Fish Hatcheries, FWS administrative sites, and other conservation areas. The Alaska National Wildlife Refuge
              Boundaries data set depicts the legislative boundary of the 16 National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska at a source scale of 1:63,360. The
              dataset was created by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7, Division of Realty and Natural Resources. The USGS substituted the
              Alaska National Wildlife Refuge boundaries for the USFWS Simplified Wildlife Refuge Boundaries in Alaska for cartographic purposes. The
              USFWS Simplified Wildlife Refuge Boundaries are simplified from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Real Estate Interest data layer
              containing polygons representing tracts of land (parcels) in which the Service has a property or management interest. These interests
              include full land ownership, secondary interests in property primarily managed and reported by other federal agencies, leased property,
              property managed by agreement with other parties, and, within National Wildlife Refuges, property governed by conservation easements. A
              conservation easement is a permanent, legally enforceable land preservation agreement between a landowner and a government agency that
              restricts real estate, commercial and industrial development of the land, which remains private property. Inholdings of private property
              within Refuge areas not covered by conservation easements are excluded from these boundaries. The Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife
              Refuge and Waterfowl production area easements acquired through the small wetlands program have been omitted. Interior boundaries
              between parcels were dissolved to produce a single set of simplified external boundaries for each feature. These are resource grade
              mapping representations of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service boundaries. For legal descriptions of the land represented here contact
              the USFWS Realty Office. This map layer was compiled by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Alaska National Wildlife Refuges dataset
              was derived from the following digital sources and legal documents: 1) Federal Register, Vol. 48, No. 38 Thursday, February 24, 1983
              Notices Pages 7890-8029. 2) USGS 1:250,000 scale Alaska Boundary Series maps entitled: Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act
              December 2, 1980 P.L. 96-487 3) Various legal documents such as survey plats, legal metes and bounds descriptions, Deeds, and Titles. 4)
              USGS 1:63,360 scale revised hydrography Digital Line Graphs depicting ground conditions from 1955 to 1986. Although these Fish and
              Wildlife boundaries represent lands administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, not all areas are open to the public. Some
              fragile habitats need to be protected from human traffic, some management areas are closed, and the terms of some conservation easements
              preclude public access. The public is urged to contact specific Refuges or other conservation areas before visiting.</othercit>

            <othercit>The PLSS information is for general reference purposes only, and should not be used to determine legal boundaries or land
              ownership. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is the authoritative source for PLSS information at the federal level, and the US Topo
              representation is derived from BLM GIS data files called Cadastral National Spatial Data Infrastructure or CadNSDI. The management of
              these data is not completely uniform throughout the country. Although this metadata record is included with all maps, PLSS is currently
              shown on US Topo Maps for only a few states. PLSS will be added to US Topo maps in more states in coming years as BLM authorized CadNSDI
              format is made available. The three layers USGS stores from PLSS are the Township, First Division and Special Surveys. Metadata for BLM
              PLSS data is at http://www.geocommunicator.gov/GeoComm/metadata/index.htm#PLSS, though this URL may change in the near future. Alternate
              sources of PLSS data will continued to be served mainly in western states where BLM is the data steward or the data is from a trusted
              source. Notes on individual states follow,----Alaska PLSS consists of protracted (computed, not surveyed) data only. For more
              information see http://sdms.ak.blm.gov/sdms/data_protracted_grid_gis.html----Ohio was the original PLSS state in the early 1800s, and
              the land network there is unusually complex. The source data include four first-division parcel types. These are all shown on US Topo
              maps, and are labeled according to BLM's attribution, with a leading letter followed by either a number or more letters. The meanings of
              the leading letters are S=Section, F=Fractional Section, L=Lot, Q=Quarter Township.</othercit>
